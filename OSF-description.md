|Panel short|OSF is an open platform to support your research and enable collaboration.|
|Short description|The OSF is an open-source collaboration tool geared towards Open Science. <br> Although not primarily a storage tool, OSF can be a very useful and easy to use way to share and publish your data, project documentation, or pre-registrations. It is possible to connect Research Drive, [Dataverse](https://libguides.vu.nl/rdm/selecting-archive?#s-lg-box-wrapper-15125672) or SURFdrive to OSF if your data volume is larger than what OSF offers. <br> The OSF is developed by the Center for Open Science (COS) that strives to increase openness, integrity, and reproducibility of research. |
