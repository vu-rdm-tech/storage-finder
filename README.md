# Storage finder

## Contents
This repository contains texts and the project management for the storage finder on the website of the Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam. The tool was custom-built for the website by VU IT developers, the code is not available. This repository contains only text, other content, and a project board to keep track of project management tasks.

## Purpose
The purpose of the tool is to give researchers (automated) guidance for choosing an appropriate storage solution for their research data. Utrecht University has a [storage finder](https://tools.uu.nl/storagefinder/) that we used as an example for our version. Researchers are also encouraged to get in touch with the [RDM Support Desk](mailto:rdm@vu.nl) if they have further questions about what storage solution best suits their purposes.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute to the texts, feel free to open an issue to this repository. Alternatively, you may email the [content lead](mailto:e.j.rodenburg@vu.nl?subject=Storage%20finder). Please also get in touch if you would like to test the tool with us.
